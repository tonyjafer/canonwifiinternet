Canon printers offer wireless convenience, but connectivity issues can disrupt printing. If your Canon printer is not connecting to WiFi or the internet, understanding the causes and applying the correct fixes is essential for restoring full functionality.

Why Is My Canon Printer Not Connecting to WiFi?
